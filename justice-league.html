                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Clark Joseph Kent (born Kal-El) is a super powerful and nigh-indestructible Kryptonian, a
                            superhero
                            of the House of El, one of the extremely few survivors of the destruction of the planet
                            Krypton, and an
                            investigative reporter of the Daily Planet alongside his lover and confidant Lois Lane.
                            In addition, Kal-El is the first Kryptonian of natural birth in centuries, the host of the
                            Growth Codex,
                            and a member of the Justice League.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">When Kal-El's father, Jor-El, realized that Krypton was doomed to
                            be destroyed,
                            he and his wife Lara sent their son to Earth, where he would be found by farmers Jonathan
                            and Martha Kent in Smallville and is taken in with them giving the infant the name "Clark
                            Kent". Using his maturing superpowers, he defends the people of Earth from various threats,
                            such as the terraforming attempt by the Kryptonian warlord General Dru-Zod and his group the
                            Sword of Rao, using the alias Superman.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">A year and a half later, after thwarting various criminals
                            throughout Metropolis and around the world, Superman grew increasingly wary of the violent
                            vigilante Batman and was ultimately forced into a fight with the Dark Knight by a new and
                            greater enemy, the malevolent supergenius Lex Luthor. However, the two of them ultimately
                            settled their differences in the end and team up with fellow hero Wonder Woman, with the
                            three of them managing to take down the unleashed Kryptonian monster Doomsday together,
                            though Superman was notably killed in the process delivering the killing blow. Earth's
                            greatest hero was honorably buried in Heroes Park, with the entire world mourning his
                            passing, and his heroically noble sacrifice inspired both Batman and Wonder Woman to begin
                            establishing the valiant Justice League in order to battle any future threats to the world
                            in his memory.</p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Bruce Wayne is the CEO of Wayne Enterprises and the main vigilante
                            operating in Gotham City, New Jersey known as the Batman. After witnessing the murder of his
                            parents at the hands of a mugger as a child, Bruce waged a war on crime in Gotham City for
                            over 20 years before the Black Zero Event. Batman is currently the leader of the Justice
                            League.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Over the years, Bruce encountered numerous foes, most notably his
                            archenemy Joker. Batman mentored the young Dick Grayson as his partner Robin, but he was
                            tragically murdered by Joker and his doctor-turned-partner, Harley Quinn. Batman later
                            apprehended Deadshot and Harley, and chased an up-and-coming Killer Croc out of Gotham
                            during his attempt to form yet another criminal empire in the city. He also encountered the
                            mercenary Deathstroke, with the latter striving to destroy him. He also faced and defeated
                            other minor villains such as the Ratcatcher, Firefly and the Riddler. After the death of
                            Robin and the immense destruction and loss of life sustained during the Black Zero Event,
                            Bruce became an increasingly ruthless guardian of Gotham City, as criminals grew wary of his
                            now brutal reputation</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">By 2015, a year and a half following the Black Zero Event, Bruce
                            had become weary of the intentions of Superman, developing a hatred of the hero further
                            fueled by the Machiavellian manipulations of LexCorp CEO and super genius Lex Luthor. His
                            fear and rage would boil over when he exchanged blows with Superman, using his technology
                            and resources to not only match Superman's strength, but counter the powers and even weaken
                            him with kryptonite he had obtained and formed into a weapon should he want to kill him.
                            However, Bruce would ultimately realize the error of his ways, and allied himself with
                            Superman to save Martha Kent. The two were later joined by Wonder Woman to defeat the
                            Kryptonian behemoth Doomsday created by Lex Luthor, though the battle cost Superman his
                            life.</p>

                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Princess Diana of Themyscira is an Amazon warrior princess and
                                one of the world's first superheroes, known as Wonder Woman. She is the daughter of
                                Queen Hippolyta and Zeus, the king of the Old Gods, as well as a member of the Justice
                                League.</p>
                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Born on Themyscira, Diana was raised in paradise, hearing
                                tales of the Amazons’ great task of defeating the corrupt God of War, Ares, ushering in
                                a new era of peace to the world. Upon coming of age, Diana began pursuing the life of a
                                warrior, despite her mother's objections. Determined to serve, she ultimately enticed
                                her aunt Antiope to train her in secret. This, however, was soon discovered by her
                                mother. Begrudgingly, the queen accepted Diana as a warrior, and ordered Antiope to
                                train her better than any other Amazon.</p>
                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">After a training session, Diana happened to come across
                                Captain Steve Trevor during his escape from the Imperial German Army in the ongoing
                                Great War. A battle soon followed, as the Germans tracked Trevor to Themyscira, where
                                they invaded in pursuit of Doctor Poison's notes. The loss of Antiope and subsequent
                                realization of mankind's downfall during the absence of the Amazons convinced Diana to
                                join the war effort, recognizing Ares as the instigator of the conflict. In the
                                following days, Diana soon uncovered Ares, who exposed her to be the God Killer, having
                                been originally conceived to be the ultimate weapon against her brother. Following this
                                revelation, a fierce battle ensued, where Diana fulfilled her purpose in freeing mankind
                                from Ares' influence.</p>
                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">The loss of Steve in World War I and the loss of her other
                                friends sometime after 1918 had left Diana broken-hearted & isolated but she vowed to
                                protect humanity whenever she was needed due to her very compassionate nature over the
                                years after 1918 but in the shadows as a mysterious female savior which people are
                                curious about on who she is. She also gained more knowledge on the world plus she
                                changed residence over the years to keep herself guarded while landing jobs at museums
                                like the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>
                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">In 1984, she came into conflict with entrepreneur Maxwell Lord
                                and former friend Barbara Minerva all while reuniting with Steve to prevent a possible
                                nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union after Lord used the
                                Dreamstone for his own means which caused global chaos and instability in the process.
                                She successfully did so after she convinced Lord and the people of the world to renounce
                                their wishes to undo the chaos created.</p>
                            <p style="padding-top: 20px;">As the world mourned for the Man of Steel, Diana combatted the
                                rise of radicals who saw Superman's death as an omen and capitalized on the world's
                                vulnerability. Shortly after the team assembled, Wonder Woman assisted in helping a
                                newly resurrected Superman regain his memories. With the team now fully assembled,
                                Wonder Woman contributed to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the
                                alien invasion into retreat. Afterwards, she began to plan for the Justice League's
                                future alongside Bruce Wayne.</p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Arthur Curry is the King of Atlantis, the firstborn son of Queen
                            Atlanna, the older maternal half-brother of Orm Marius, and a member of the Justice League,
                            as well as the superhero known to the world as the Aquaman.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">During his childhood in Amnesty Bay, Maine, he was secretly
                            trained by his vizier Nuidis Vulko in hand-to-hand combat and gifted with his mother's
                            trident as a blessing. While he was initially reserved and content with his self-imposed
                            isolation from both the surface world and Atlantis, which was due to his mother's forced
                            abandonment of him and his father Tom Curry as a child by Orm's father Orvax, Aquaman would
                            eventually be recruited by Batman to join the newly formed Justice League in order to help
                            defend Earth against the alien forces of Steppenwolf and his Parademon army, despite being
                            initially reluctant to get involved at first.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Following his recruitment to the team, Arthur played a pivotal
                            role in reviving Superman a year after the latter's death at the hands of the monstrous
                            Doomsday. With the Justice League now fully assembled, Aquaman contributed considerably into
                            driving back Steppenwolf, even severely injuring the latter with his trident, forcing the
                            failed alien invasion into hasty retreat.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Roughly a year later, Arthur reluctantly decided to finally pursue
                            his rightful place in Atlantis – he retrieved the legendary Trident of Atlan from the depths
                            of the Hidden Sea with the help of Mera and his long lost mother Atlanna, and defeated his
                            half-brother Orm in battle, finally becoming the rightful King of Atlantis at last, though
                            in the process he also unintentionally created a new and dangerous villain hellbent on
                            destroying him, Black Manta.</p>
                        <P style="padding-top: 20px;">Arthur was visited by Bruce Wayne in Iceland, who had eventually
                            tracked him down using files given to him by Amanda Waller.[1] Bruce arrived during the
                            winter, during which time Arthur brought fish to feed the hungry, always coming into town on
                            the King tide. On the day afterwards, Bruce asked the village's council if he could speak
                            with Arthur, whom he deduced was still around</P>
                        <P style="padding-top: 20px;">When Arthur revealed himself to be there, he demanded Bruce talk,
                            during which he informed Arthur that an impending threat was coming to the world, asking
                            Arthur to join the newly founded Justice League under his leadership. Initially, Arthur
                            refused to become involved with, and risk his life for, a group of strangers. He responded
                            with hostility when Bruce made a quip about Atlantis and proceeding to pin Bruce against the
                            wall in an attempt to intimidate him.</P>
                        <P style="padding-top: 20px;">However, he decided to hear Bruce out, where the latter disclosed
                            that he was Batman. Bruce commented on the rumors surrounding Arthur, amusingly pointing out
                            his ability to "talk to fish." Afterwards, while Arthur was beginning to depart back to the
                            ocean, he remarked that 'the strong man is strongest alone', to which Bruce, incredulous,
                            commented that Arthur had gotten the actual saying backward</P>

                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Bartholomew Henry "Barry" Allen is a student at Central City
                            University who was struck by a bolt of lightning one fateful night, gaining the ability to
                            think and move at incredible superhuman speeds. Using these powers, he became a superhero in
                            Central City known as The Flash, fighting against criminals like Captain Boomerang while
                            trying his best to keep a low profile in the process. He is also desperate to prove his
                            father's innocence for the grisly murder of his mother.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">He was eventually discovered and subsequently monitored by
                            supergenius Lex Luthor and was then later recruited by Bruce Wayne to be a member of the
                            Justice League in order to help defend Earth after the death of Superman at the hands of
                            Doomsday.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Following his recruitment to the team, Flash played a pivotal role
                            in the resurrection of Superman. With the team now fully assembled, Flash greatly
                            contributed to the successful assault against the forces of General Steppenwolf of
                            Apokolips, forcing the alien invasion to retreat from Earth. Afterwards, Barry was hired for
                            a position at the Central City Police Department's crime lab, much to his imprisoned
                            father's delight.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Later, he used the Speed Force to travel across the multiverse,
                            and, at various points during his travels, met another version of himself and an alternate
                            version of Batman, from different universes.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Arriving in Gotham, Barry and Bruce rendezvous with Diana Prince,
                            who informs the latter on her
                            progress with Victor Stone's recruitment. Just then, Barry sees the Bat Signal and
                            excitingly
                            reminds Bruce that it meant they should get going, leading to Bruce and Diana sharing a look
                            over the young vigilante's behavior.</p>

                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Victor Stone is a former college athlete and football star.
                            Following a horrific accident that resulted in the death of his mother, Victor was gravely
                            injured and was extremely close to death. His father, Silas Stone, was able to save him via
                            the use of a Mother Box that crafted cybernetics onto him, managing to save his life but
                            leaving him alienated and detached from the rest of humanity due to complications with his
                            new form.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">He would eventually be recruited by the Batman and Wonder Woman to
                            become a member of the Justice League, to help defend Earth against the imminent alien
                            invasion of Steppenwolf and his Parademon army.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Shortly after joining the team, Victor assisted the Batman and the
                            Flash in resurrecting Superman from the dead. With the team now fully assembled, Cyborg
                            contributes to the successful offensive against Steppenwolf, forcing the alien invasion into
                            retreat.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Following this, Victor finally reveals himself to the world,
                            officially becoming a superhero and nicknamed Cyborg, having further plans for the
                            newly-founded Justice League made by Batman.</p>
                        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">After fighting alongside the Justice League for some time,
                            however, Cyborg seems to have warmed a bit to all of his teammates, as he bonds a bit with
                            Flash over their unexpected metahuman power gain (though he still found the latter's humor a
                            bit annoying), he somewhat bonds with Batman over their engineering expertise, he notably
                            reassures the previously skeptical Aquaman that "the ride ain't over yet" (before helping
                            the Atlantean fight a group of Parademons), he comes to appreciate Wonder Woman's emotional
                            support, and even shares a laugh of relief with resurrected Superman (after they
                            successfully pry apart the 3 Mother Boxes). Indeed, Cyborg is the first member of the League
                            to have befriended every single one of his teammates during their first major battle.
                            Superman's return and the defeat of Steppenwolf finally grants Cyborg the confidence to
                            reveal his cybernetic self to the world, and begin mending his strained relationship with
                            his father, as he is seen beginning to work with Silas at S.T.A.R. Labs.</p>
